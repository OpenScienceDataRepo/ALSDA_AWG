# ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/about.html) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for ALSDA AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**ALSDA AWG Overview**  
The Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) Analysis Working Group (AWG) was formed to bring together Principal Investigators (PI) and Subject Matter Experts (SME) to weigh-in on the new ALSDA data submission portal and data system. PI and SME input will be sought to transition ALSDA data systems towards being FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) and Open.

The purpose of the ALSDA AWG is to solicit feedback from the science community regarding [ALSDA](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html) user experience, data collection, and metadata standards. The feedback will aid in optimizing ALSDA's data sharing systems to enable data mining and meta-analyses, along with various data science artificial intelligence approaches. This collaborative approach maximizes data re-use and facilitates new knowledge discoveries. The AWG also iteratively assesses and provides feedback on the effectiveness of the ALSDA data system by collaboratively conducting analytical studies utilizing [ALSDA data](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/search?q=&data_source=alsda&data_type=study).
